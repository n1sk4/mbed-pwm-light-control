PWM light control using Mbed LPC1768

Light control by using PWM signal to regulate the brightness of the LED light strip.
The PWM signal is connected to the Power source by using some kind of Galvanic isolation,
and the signal travels trough the MOSFET switch to the LED strip.

You can control the brightness or switching ON/OFF by using:
  -> Rotary encoder
  or by using keywords:
  -> USB 2.0 to serial terminal on the PC
  -> Using a Bluetooth device
